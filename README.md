# Linktree
I created my own LinkTree from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JS.
A LinkTree is a website that allows the creator to have all of their important links in one place so that users can quickly find the website they need.

# What is in my LinkTree?
I have attached my portfolio website, all of my deployed projects, my socials for LinkedIn, my GitHub profile, and my instagram.
